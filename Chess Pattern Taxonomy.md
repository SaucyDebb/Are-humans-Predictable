# Chess Pattern Taxonomy
The most commonly used patterns are as below. 
The first stages of training would mainly only focus on this common pattern and while expand further in the future.

# ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess Pattern Groups
| Group             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Opening Patterns  | Recognizable sequences of early moves that define the structure of the game |
| Tactical Motifs   | Short-term, calculable patterns that lead to material gain or advantage     |
| Strategic Themes  | Long-term positional ideas that guide planning and piece placement          |
| Endgame Patterns  | Techniques and positions that arise when few pieces remain                  |

# Why are only this 4 groups selected?
These four are the core pillars, widely accepted in chess pedagogy and analysis.

# ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess Pattern Examples
| Group             | Examples                                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Opening Patterns  | Sicilian Defense, Queen‚Äôs Gambit, etc.               |
| Tactical Motifs   | Forks, Pins, Skewers, Discovered Attacks, etc.       |
| Strategic Themes  | Passed pawns, Weak squares, Open files               |
| Endgame Patterns  | Lucena position, Philidor position, Opposition       |

# ‚ôüÔ∏è Does every Four Pattern Types Emerge in Every Match?
Not all matches showcase every pattern type‚Äîespecially in blitz or beginner games. However, high-level games often touch all four, even if briefly.

# üß© Non-Chess Players / Low-Rated Games
| Pattern Type | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Opening      | Often random or inconsistent. May resemble known openings but quickly diverge. |
| Tactics      | May appear accidentally (e.g., a fork happens but wasn‚Äôt planned).          |
| Strategy     | Rarely intentional. Positional ideas are often missed.                      |
| Endgame      | Many games end before reaching a true endgame phase.                        |

# üß† High-Rated Players (2000+ Elo)
| Pattern Type | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Opening      | Almost always follows a known line for 10‚Äì15 moves.                         |
| Tactics      | Deliberate and frequent. Players spot and exploit motifs.                  |
| Strategy     | Deeply embedded in decision-making.                                         |
| Endgame      | If reached, often showcases textbook patterns like Lucena or Philidor.      |
 
High-level games tend to incorporate all four‚Äîeven if only briefly.

# ‚ôüÔ∏è Can Multiple Patterns Emerge Within Each Group?
Absolutely. Each group represents a category, not a single label‚Äîso multiple patterns can coexist and repeat within a single game.

# üß† Examples of Pattern Multiplicity
| Group     | Possible Multiple Patterns in One Game                                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Opening   | A game might start with the Sicilian Defense and transpose into the Dragon Variation    |
| Tactics   | Forks, Pins, Skewers, Discovered Attacks‚Äîall can appear in one middlegame               |
| Strategy  | Passed pawns, weak squares, open files, bishop pair‚Äîall layered together                |
| Endgame   | Lucena position followed by opposition and zugzwang sequences                           |

# How are them labbeled?  
The tagging system supports multiple labels per group and even multiple instances of the same label.  
For example: `Fork at move 12` and `Fork at move 27` can both be valid entries.

# üîÆ In the Future
Chess is much more complicated due to human influence and variability. In the future, I plan to explore additional frameworks and patterns to further reinforce the model.
| Group                  | Examples                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transition Patterns    | How a game shifts from opening to middlegame, or middlegame to endgame   |
| Psychological Patterns | Time pressure blunders, baiting, or tilt-induced decisions               |
| Error Patterns         | Blunders, inaccuracies, missed tactics                                   |
